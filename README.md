# Hardhat examples

This repository contains examples showing how to do certain things in [Hardhat](http://hardhat.org/). If you want to
see something else included, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/fvictorio/hardhat-examples/issues/new).

## Parallel tests

You can run your Hardhat [tests in parallel](/parallel-tests). All you have to do is to install `mocha` and change the
command you use to run them. Check the example to learn more.
